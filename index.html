            <p> Undergraduate student at Brawijaya University, majoring in Information Technology Education, with NIM 235150600111015. I have several hobbies, such as learning new things, listening to podcast, music, and watching films. 
                Currently, I am developing skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and i'm also learning MySQL to understand databases. Entering the IT field is something special for me, as i had no prior knowledge of it before. My 1.5 years at the Faculty Of Computer Science 
                have motivated me to keep creating and practicing both in IT and other areas. My desire to achieve success and participate in various competitions keeps pushing me to discover new things. My dream is to become a web developer, and this ambition fuels my continuous
                efforts to participate in competitions and discover new opportunities. </p><br><p>~ Time is what we want most and what we use worst ~ </p>

                    <p><b>Microsoft Office</b></p><br>
                    <p>I possess strong proficiency in using Microsoft Office, a productivity software suite that is essential across various industries.
                        My expertise includes Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, all of which i use effectively to support a wide range of administrative
                        and analytical tasks. In Microsoft Word, i am capable of creating professional documents with proper formatting, utilizing advanced 
                        features such as mail merge, track changes, and constructing tables and charts that complement data presentation. In Microsoft Excel,
                        i am highly skilled in managing data, using formulas and functions to perform complex calculations, and analyzing data through pivot tables. 
                        Moreover, in Microsoft PowerPoint, i can design effective and engaging presentations, leveraging strong visual design principles to convey 
                        information clearly and persuasively. </p>

                    <h4>Hard Skill</h4><br>
                    <p><b>Foreign Language Proficiency (English and Arabic)</b></p><br>
                    <p> I have developed a strong proficiency in both English and Arabic, cultivated through a combination of formal education, immersive experiences, 
                        and consistent practical use. My command of these languages goes beyond conversational fluency, allowing me to engage effectively in professional, 
                        academic, and cross-cultural contexts. This dual-language proficiency has enabled me to communicate complex ideas, negotiate, and interact with 
                        diverse audiences, adapting my approach as needed for different settings. In English, I am skilled in both written and spoken forms, proficient in 
                        articulating ideas clearly and concisely. Similarly, my Arabic skills encompass Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various dialects, allowing me to 
                        navigate both formal and informal communication. This linguistic versatility has proven invaluable in understanding and appreciating the nuances of 
                        Arab cultures, bridging cultural divides, and fostering meaningful connections.

                    <h4>Hard Skill</h4><br>
                    <p><b>Programming</b></p><br>
                    <p> I have a bassic skill set in programming, with several languages that i have studied and continue to learn, including HTML, Jaca,
                        CSS, and PHP. I began developing my programming abilities when i entered college, and although my skills are still evolving, i remain
                        motivated to keep learning and practicing to improve. This drive pushes me to explore new concepts continuously so that i can eventually
                        contribute fresh ideas to my field. Here is a brief explanation of these programming languages:
                        CSS is a design language used to style and layout elements on a web page. With CSS, we can set colors, fonts, sizes, positioning, and animations
                        for HTML elements. PHP, PHP is a server - side programming language primarily used for web development. It processed code on the server and outputs
                        HTML to be displayed in a browser. Java, Java is a general purpose, object-oriented programming language well known for its portability. Java is used
                        in various applications, from dekstop and web applications to mobile development. HTML is a markup language used to create the structure of web pages.
                        It uses elements and tags to organize content, such as text, images, links, videos, and forms on a web pages, where the main content is defined before 
                        being styled with CSS and enhanced with functionally using JavaScript or PHP.  </p>

                    <h4>Soft Skill</h4><br>
                    <p><b>Collaboration Skills</b></p><br>
                    <p> In addition to the hard skills mentioned earlier, I have also developed various soft skills, including strong collaboration abilities. 
                        Working well in a team has been essential for me to accomplish many goals, from participating in organizations, competitions, and committees 
                        to taking on numerous other group projects. Each experience has provided valuable opportunities to practice and enhance my collaborative skills.
                        Over time, I have trained myself to adapt quickly and work effectively with others in diverse environments, allowing me to contribute meaningfully
                        to team efforts while fostering a supportive and communicative atmosphere. Through these experiences, I've learned the importance of empathy, 
                        active listening, and flexibility—qualities that allow me to understand different perspectives, adjust to changing circumstances, and help guide my 
                        teams toward shared goals. This adaptability has proven valuable in various settings, strengthening my ability to collaborate seamlessly, whether in a 
                        leadership role or as a supporting team member. </p>

                    <h4>Soft Skill</h4><br>
                    <p><b>Time Management</b></p><br>
                    <p> I have cultivated a strong foundation in time management, which has proven invaluable for balancing diverse responsibilities and achieving my goals efficiently.
                        Managing time effectively is a skill I’ve honed through various academic, organizational, and personal projects, where deadlines, task prioritization, and flexibility 
                        are essential to success. By developing strategies such as breaking down large tasks into manageable steps, setting clear priorities, and allocating specific time blocks 
                        to each responsibility, I can maintain focus and productivity even when handling multiple commitments. One of the most valuable aspects of my time management approach is 
                        setting realistic, achievable deadlines while maintaining a high standard of quality. Additionally, I’ve learned to adapt my approach depending on the specific demands 
                        of each task, whether it's a fast-paced project requiring immediate attention or a long-term objective requiring sustained effort.

                    <p><b>Effective Communication</b></p><br>
                    <p>Effective communication is an essential soft skill in many areas of life, both professional and personal. This skill involves the ability to convey ideas or information clearly 
                       and accurately, as well as the ability to listen to and understand others' perspectives. Effective communication relies not only on using the right words but also involves body language, 
                       tone of voice, and an empathetic response to others. In a work setting, effective communication helps build positive relationships among team members, reduces potential misunderstandings, 
                       and boosts productivity. Individuals with strong communication skills are typically better able to explain their ideas in an organized way, provide constructive feedback, and understand and 
                       appropriately respond to feedback they receive. This skill also makes collaboration smoother, as those who communicate effectively are better equipped to form respectful and harmonious working relationships.
